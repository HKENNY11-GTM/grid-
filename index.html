            <p class="paragraphs">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
            <p class="sujet">"Before joining the bootcamp.I've never written a line code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assisatance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no turtorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my devolopment experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full stack devoloper after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"</p>
